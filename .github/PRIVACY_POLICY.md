# QRServ Privacy Policy

QRServ does not collect or send any information that might be personal or personally identifiable. There is no in-app data collection.

QRServ hosts content that the user specifically selects and that selection is then made available to any network the device being utilised is connected to. This could be on a Local Area Network (including mobile tethering and common access points), Wide Area Network (depending on the network configuration) and/or a connected VPN.
QRServ's on-device HTTP server that hosts the content can be stopped via the in-app control at any time. The port number that the HTTP server ends up with on each re-run is the one that the device's system provides of which is deemed unused at the time.

Other than the above, QRServ utilises Google Play Core libraries on launch in order to perform an in-app update check.
<br>
The information sent is at its absolute minimum and nothing extra compared to what Google Play Services would usually send out for analytical purposes (regardless if the published application has an analytics solution included).
<br>
For more information, including what data is specifically collected, refer to the guide regarding in-app updates: https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates

-   android.permission.INTERNET -- Collection of available network interfaces and port binding for the HTTP server, in-app update check
-   android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE -- Read-only access to emulated, physical SD card(s) and USB mass storage
