<p><i>QRServ</i> takes any selected file on your device and makes it available through its own HTTP server at an unused port number. The selected file can then be downloaded via web browser on another device or software that allows file downloads over HTTP from QR codes.</p><p><br><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>QR Code</li><li>Share option</li><li>Show and hide filename in download URL path (Long press the share button to toggle)</li><li>Various IP addresses from different network interfaces can be chosen</li><li>HTTP server uses an unused ("random") port</li><li>Supports various languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish</li></ul><p><b>Important:</b></p><p>Please note that you should have sufficient internal storage to make a copy of the same file as it is stored into QRServ's app storage rather than being directly accessed (as to combat MITD attacks and work with later Android API restrictions).</p><p>To clear the selected file out from the app&#39;s own storage, either shutdown the server or relaunch the app after forcefully stopping it. Selecting another file will remove the previous one but that is after the new file gets stored so ensure you have enough internal storage for that as well.</p><p><br><b>Permission usage:</b></p><ul><li><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> -- Collection of available network interfaces and port binding for the HTTP server</li><li><code>android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> -- Read-only access to emulated, physical SD card(s) and USB mass storage</li></ul><p>QRServ is open source and available for desktop.</p>
